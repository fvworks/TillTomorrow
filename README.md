![Till Tomorrow](landscape.png)

You, an enthusiastic adventurer, never stop voyaging and searching for the 'paradise' of your own. One day, however, a fierce hurricane destroyed your boat and threw you, the only survivor, into an island previously unknown to anyone...Lonely and desperate, you are trying to survive on very limited resources available, while fighting against the hostile environment occasionally. When rescue doesn't seem possible anymore, will you be able to thrive along with the island? Is it possible for you to find any companies? What's the secrete hidden beneath this normal-appeared island?...All those questions hanging in your mind will not be answered till tomorrow...
